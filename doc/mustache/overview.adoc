## Description

Boost.Mustache is an implementation of
http://mustache.github.io/[Mustache templates] in {cpp}11.

Mustache is a simple templating language in which tags of
the form `{{something}}` are replaced with the value of
the entity `something`, which typically means with the member
`"something"` of the JSON object passed when rendering the template.

Boost.Mustache can take a Boost.JSON `object` as the context against
which data references are resolved, but it can also take arbitrary
values that can be converted to `boost::json::value` by using
`boost::json::value_from`. This allows, for instance, described classes
(structs and classes annotated with https://boost.org/libs/describe[Boost.Describe])
to be passed as the data context, such that references to e.g. `{{title}}`
in the template are resolved to the corresponding `title` member of the
class.

Boost.Mustache implements the mandatory portions of the
https://github.com/mustache/spec[Mustache specification]. At the
moment it doesn't implement any of the extensions.
